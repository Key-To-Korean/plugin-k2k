# K2K

`Version 1.2.0`

- [Plugin Page](https://github.com/jekkilekki/plugin-k2k)
- [Author Page](https://aaron.kr/)

A complete Language Learning plugin that adds multiple new Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, and Page Templates for language learning blogs and sites.

## Description

enable me to better organize the grammar points I'm studying. It includes the following helper plugins:

### [JKL Daily Challenge](https://github.com/jekkilekki/plugin-k2k/tree/master/includes/vendor/jkl-daily-challenge) (Coming)

**Purpose:** An addition to the homepage, to daily present visitors with new Korean language challenges including:

- 20-30 vocabulary words to review
- 3 grammar points to learn
- 3 new phrases to try out
- 1 reading challenge
- 1 writing challenge
- 1 speaking challenge

It is visible anew every morning on the homepage in a dark box, and adds checkboxes to each checklist item. After users complete each item, they check them off the list. After ALL are checked off the list, the dark box changes to reveal a congratulatory message for the day.

Therefore, individual users are tracked with browser cookies on a daily basis. There is also an option to "Reset Daily Challenge" if the user accidentally completes it too early.

If you want to help translate the plugin into your language, please have a look
at the `.pot` file which contains all definitions and may be used with a [gettext]
editor.

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one,
you can send your [gettext .po or .mo file] to me so that I can bundle it in the

## FAQs

**Tips**

As a general rule, it is always best to keep your WordPress installation and all
Themes and Plugins fully updated in order to avoid problems with this or any other
Themees or Plugins. I regularly update my site and test my Plugins and Themes with
the latest version of WordPress.

**When I select something from the dropdown menus on the archive page, I get a 404 error.**

Please navigate to your WordPress Dashboard, go to `Settings -> Permalinks` and click the "Save"
button. You just need to "flush" the permalink rewrite rules in this way.

**Can you ADD / REMOVE / CHANGE features of the plugin?**

Sure, I'm always open to suggestions. Let me know what you're looking for. Feel
free to open a GitHub Issue on the [plugin repository](https://github.com/jekkilekki/plugin-k2k/issues)
to let me know the specific features or problems you're having.
